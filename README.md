# RailTrack_Segmentation
Codes of RailTrack_Segmentation of TITS2021-Enhanced Few-Shot Learning for Intrusion Detection in Railway Video Surveillance.<br>
Sorry that we cannot provide the local dataset.<br>
An open-source project based on PaddlePaddle of this paper is given on [here](https://github.com/wc253/Paddle_Few-Shot-Learning-for-Intrusion-Detection-in-Railway-Video-Surveillan)
The used RailSem19 from [here](https://wilddash.cc/) is a useful dataset for vision-based rail reasearch. The RailSem19 has 8500 images
taken from the ego-perspective of rail vehicles.<br>
You should pre-process this dataset for the selected labels as follows<br>
