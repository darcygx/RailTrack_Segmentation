# RailTrack_Segmentation
Codes of RailTrack_Segmentation of TITS2021-Enhanced Few-Shot Learning for Intrusion Detection in Railway Video Surveillance.<br>
Sorry that we cannot provide the local dataset.<br>
The open source RailSem19 from [here](https://wilddash.cc/) is useful dataset for vision-based rail reasearch.<br>
You should pre-process this dataset for the selected labels as follows<br>
